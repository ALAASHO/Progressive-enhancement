<blockquote class="glow" >
  <p class="blod"> Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,</p>    <q class="villager"> We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate. </q>  The farmer said, <q class="farmer" > <strong> Maybe.  </strong></q>  .The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villager" > Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses! </q>  The farmer again said,<q class="farmer" ><strong> Maybe. </strong> </q>
  The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="villager" > Oh dear, that’s too <strong class="bad"> Bad </strong>,</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><strong> Maybe.  </strong></q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="farmer"> Isn’t that great! </q> Again, he said,<q class="farmer" > <em> ”Maybe.”  </em></q>

  The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <strong class="good">Good </strong>  or <strong class="bad"> Bad </strong> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <strong class="good" > good </strong>  fortune.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
